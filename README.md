I connect the frontend app (Next.js) with the backend app (Django).

When you connect to the frontend application, you will see a message showing you the login page direction.

At the login, you have the option to create an account if you do not have yet.

You can go to register page to create one.

In login and register page, i implement server-side validation using [zod](https://zod.dev/?id=introduction), a typescript library to validate data before contacting the backend app for further processing.

Successful login triggers user redirection to the home page where data are fetching from the backend app.

As soon as user clicks on `Upload file` button, a form for submitting file is displayed.

User uploads are registered in the backend and a FTP server for storage stuff, and the table gets filled with user data. 

A challenge was to add `Download` and `Delete` functionalities. Thanks to God and my motivation, i did it ðŸ˜Š.

So, it's your turn to clone that repo and enjoy my app ðŸ¥°.

A nice feature that i've also added to my app is the filtering. By typing something in the search bar, only files which names match that pattern appears in the table.

In case of no matching, `No matches found` is displayed to users.
